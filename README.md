See the published web app: https://beatrizsabbatini.github.io/kanban-board/

## How to run this project on your computer:

First, we need to install the dependencies. You can either use yarn, or npm for this.

### `yarn`

or

### `npm install`

Now, for running the project if you installed the dependencies using yarn:

### `yarn start`

or, if you used npm:

### `npm start`

That´s it! The project will automatically open up in your default browser, using the url: 

### `http://localhost:3000`


## Scripts that I used to build and deploy:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn run deploy`

Deploys the code from the branch gh-pages to the published url:
